The player need to find missing number by scan rows, columns and regions to figure out where is only one legal place for that number. It's help for improves memory and logic when it used for memorize the numbers.

## Planning and Development Process

A basic story of your planning and developing this project.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

The approach used to solve the problems faced during write the code was at each line of code that assign, retrieve or store value printing it in console log and inspect it's result using the developer tools provided by google chrome. Also using alert() in conditional situation.

### Unsolved problems

```
- saving the user progress and the ability of resuming the game.
- generate new grid randomly
- add the ability of making notes in cells
```
